## *Reflection:*
The purpose of this project is to see how we could use our basic html and css skills to recreate a website from scratch. This project gives us a chance to recreate our favorite website's and put a little touches that would benefit the website. I chose my favorite social media platform instagram, and I decided to create it to change some aspects to this login or sign up screen. I learned a lot with this project because I had to use a lot of resources that my fellow classmates presented to me in order to create my website. This was a challenge because I had to rely on my note taking skills in order to finish this project. I also used outside resources such as stack overflow in order to freshen up on certain things and learn a couple of new things.
