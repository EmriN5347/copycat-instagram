## *Reflection:*
The purpose of this project is to see how we could use our basic html and css skills to recreate a website from scratch. This project gives us a chance to re-create our favorite website's and put a little touchs that would benefit the website. I chose my favorite social media platform instagram, and I decided to created it to change some aspects to this login or sign up screen. Throughout this process I learned many things that will help me on my freedom project.
